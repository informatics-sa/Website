# Developer documentation

## How does the website work?
- Any maintainer/developer commits some changes to Github
- Github workflow runs [`build.py`](https://github.com/informatics-sa/Website/blob/main/build.py) script
- `build.py` builds all HTML pages only by their [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/)
- Jekyll builds the pages based on `layout` field in the front matter, layouts are written in [`_layouts` folder](https://github.com/informatics-sa/Website/tree/main/root/_layouts)
- Github workflow finishes and Github pages hosts the static HTML website

## The library
The core library serves the core JSON files and takes care of some error handling and merging data togother.

Here is a **TODO list**:
- Error handling
- Add more data checking on the files with clear error messages

## Languages and Translation
- [`translations.json`](https://sainformatics.org/data/translations.json) for any string generated by `build.py`
- [`_data/` folder](https://github.com/informatics-sa/Website/tree/main/root/_data)
- Any other strings in `_layouts` folder

**TODO**: move any `if page.lang == ...` in all layouts and use `_data` strings like `data[page.lang].string_name`

## Future projects
You might check the [original TODO list](https://github.com/informatics-sa/Website/blob/main/TODO.md), but it's up to your laziness if you will do them.
